\section{Summary}
In the past six years, I have worked as a full stack developer and mobile developer. Although I worked with different technologies, my preference is in the development of Android and iOS apps in which I have devoted a significant amount of my spare time during the years.  My first two years in Novatec was working with databases, PHP and JavaScript implementing both Backend and Frontend logic.  After that I moved to mobile development.  I have a significant experience of Android Studio for Android development, xCode for iOS development and Eclipse and Zend Studio for PHP development.  In the future, I would like to see myself as a part of an native mobile development team.
