\section{Summary}
In the past six years I have worked as a full stack developer and as a mobile developer. Although I worked with different technologies I prefer developing Android and iOS apps to which I have devoted significant amount of my spare time during years. For the first two years in Novatec I was working with databases, PHP and JavaScript implementing both backend and frontend logic, after that I moved to mobile development. I have a good knowledge of Android Studio for Android development, xCode for iOS development and Eclipse and Zend Studio for PHP development. In a following years of my career I would like to see myself as a part of an native mobile development team.
